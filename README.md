## Important tips 
throw away the data of 1st to 8th because of the fesitival
to balance the numbers of working days and weekends so throw away the 9th and 10th 
so use the data of 11th to 24th (2 weeks, of which we have 10 working days and 4 weekends) 
to predict the time, we have two catagories 
use the median 
the first station is very important
